# sqlProject info
this is a project made using lessons learnt in web development and Database management.
Its called **Organiser**.

# What is Organiser?
its basically a planning tool that enables you to list activities to be done and monitor the progress of your project via an easy to use planboard. Also the code is a mess so kindly dont change anything otherwise it may stop working, thank you in advance.

# note
**IMPORTANT POINTS**
    - make sure you create a database called 'organiser' in your mysql workbench
    - the project uses nodejs to run the backend
    - the system will set itself up as long as nodejs and mysql are running

# final change
**MORE INFO**
